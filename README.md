# DLSR_final_project
DeepLearning Systems and Inference Realization

## Introduction  
This project mainly discusses the Enas model performance. We compared Enas model and the classic model like resnet18, resnet101, and densenet121 with the data loader balance weight sampler, image augmentation method and tensorrt then observe the performance of these models.
